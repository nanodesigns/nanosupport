# How to contribute - NanoSupport
You are here because you liked NanoSupport and want it to be even better. Yes, you can contribute to make it far better. Here are some ways:

## Bug Fixing and Improvements

* improve the code
* add new feature

### Developer Guide
Before moving to the development process, make sure you followed the [NanoSupport Developer Guide](https://github.com/nanodesigns/nanosupport/wiki/Developer-Guide), so that you can set up all the necessary things before you proceed.

We're managing things using:

* `yarn` ([Installing yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)), and
* `grunt` ([Installing grunt](https://gruntjs.com/getting-started))

Open the command console and type the following to install dependencies:

````bash
git clone https://github.com/nanodesigns/nanosupport.git nanosupport && cd nanosupport && yarn install && grunt
````

This code will download the plugin code, install node_modules and will build necessary javascripts and styles.
