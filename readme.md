## Introduction
Create a fully featured Support Center within your WordPress environment without any third party system dependency &mdash; completely FREE. It has built-in Knowledgebase too. **No** 3rd party support ticketing system required, **no** external site/API dependency, **simply** create your own fully featured Support Center within your WordPress environment, and take your support into the next level.

It has a built-in Knowledgebase that can be used for information that are for public acknowledgement.

The plugin is to provide support to your users - the users those are taking product or services from you.
